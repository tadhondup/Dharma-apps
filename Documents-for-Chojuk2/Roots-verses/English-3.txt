\b
\v 10 I rejoice in the deliverance of embodied beings from the griefs of life’s wanderings, and in the Sonship of Enlightenment, and the Enlightenment that belongs to the Saviours.
\b
\v 11 I rejoice in the Commanders’ oceans of Thought, that bring happiness and establish welfare for all creatures.
